# About Šolar and Lektor

## 1. [Šolar](http://ssj.slovenscina.eu/korpusi/solar)

Corpora are electronic collections of authentic texts, created according to
predetermined criteria with a specific goal, and equipped with tools that
enable a multifaceted search of linguistic data. The corpus of school written
products Šolar is a corpus of texts that pupils of Slovenian primary and
secondary schools independently create during lessons. The corpus was created
within the Communication in Slovenian language project framework in 2009-2010,
and it contains almost a million words or 967,477 words to be exact. It is the
first corpus of texts of its kind in Slovenia, which is modeled after language
acquisition corpora. Still, it differs from most of these corpora in that

_(a)_ the texts were not created at the initiative of the project, but represent
the actual school production of pupils and students, and

_(b)_ the language corrections marked in the corpus are natural and made by
teachers and not by researchers.

Due to the use of teacher's corrections to mark students' language errors,
the corpus is unique not only in Slovenia but also on a European or global
scale.

## 2. [Lektor](http://ssj.slovenscina.eu/korpusi/lektor)

Corpus Lektor is an extensive collection of proofread author's texts and
translations intended for anyone interested in the proofreading process. Newer
non-literary, mostly professional and popular science texts by various authors
and translators, which were proofread by various proofreaders, are collected.
The corpus contains texts in two versions, namely combining the original
author's text and the proofread text. Texts in digital format are written in xml
format, namely in such a way that the original and proofread text can be
displayed at the same time or in parallel, and proofreading interventions are
defined by types according to a predetermined classification. The corpus is
accessible as a text in xml format and online in an interface that allows
searching both by text and by metadata (types of corrections, information about
the proofreader (gender, age, education – linguistics/non-linguistics,
Slovenian/non-Slovenian), and information about the origin – whether it is a
translation or an author's text).
