# Grammar Error Handling

The grammar error handling (GEH) problem was split into three sub-problems:
- grammar error detection (GED),
- grammar error recognition (GER), and
- grammar error correction (GEC).

In the `analyze_data` folder, we have analyzed our datasets, which we created in the `prepare_data` folder. The `train_model` folder contains the process of fine-tuning the large language models.
